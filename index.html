<blockquote>
<p>The Connectathon tests run on top of an NFS mount, and therefore test the behavior of a real (kernel) NFS client against a server. They can also be used for testing filesystems other than NFS. </p>

<p>These directories contain programs that can be used to test an
implementation of the NFS Protocol.  The tests run on a UNIX client and
test server and client functions.  (See READWIN.txt for information
about running on DOS and Windows.)  The tests are divided into three
groups:</p>

<pre><code>basic   - basic file system operations tests
general - general file system tests
special - tests that poke certain common problem areas
lock    - tests that exercise network locking
</code></pre>

<p>This README is divided into five sections.  The first section is the
introduction, which you are reading now.  That is followed by a
description of what you have to do before you run the testsuites on
your machine.  Then comes a description of how the testsuites are run
in general followed by a description of how they are used at
Connectathon.  The last section describes what each test does in
detail.</p>

<p>This testsuite should run on both BSD and System V based systems.  The
System V Release 3 port of the Connectathon Testsuite is provided
courtesy of the Lachman Technology, Incorporated, 1901 N. Naper Blvd.,
Naperville, IL.  60563.</p>

<a id="preparing-to-run-the-testsuites" class="anchor" href="#preparing-to-run-the-testsuites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preparing to run the Testsuites</h1>

<p>To prepare to run the testsuites on your machine, change directories
to the highest level testsuite directory (it should be the same one
that contains this README file), edit tests.init according to the
platform you are on, and type "make" to compile the test programs.  If
you are not sure you are in the correct directory, type "ls -CF" and
you should see the following files and directories:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-text-shell-session"><pre><span class="pl-mo">Makefile    basic/      lock/       tests.h</span>
<span class="pl-mo">README      domount.c   runtests    tests.init</span>
<span class="pl-mo">READWIN.txt general/    server      tools/</span>
<span class="pl-mo">Testitems   getopt.c    special/    unixdos.h</span></pre></div>

<p>The "server" script uses "getopt".  A source file of a public-domain
version of "getopt" is included in the directory.  The Makefile will
compile it for you.</p>

<p>The tests are configured according to parameters found in the script,
tests.init.  It contains various definitions for commands and
parameters used by the various Makefiles and shell scripts.  This file
should be checked and then perhaps modified to correctly match your
system.  In particular, the values of "MOUNTCMD", "UMOUNTCMD", "PATH",
"CFLAGS", and "LIBS" should be checked and set correctly.  There are
several sets of suggested values which may be used as possible starting
places.</p>

<p>Two special targets are included in the Makefiles: copy and dist. The
command, "make copy DESTDIR="path"", where "path" is the absolute name
of a directory, will cause the compiled tests to be copied to "path".
The command, "make dist DESTDIR="path"", where "path" is the absolute
name of a directory, will copy the test sources to "path".  DESTDIR
must be specified on the make command line when making either of these
targets.</p>

<p>Modifications may be required so the programs compile on your machine.
If that is so, we would like to know what they are so that we can
incorporate them into our distribution.</p>

<p>When defaults are used, the test programs expect the directory,
/server, to exist on the server.  The test driver will use the
directory /mnt/'server_name' on the client, creating it first if
necessary (where 'server_name' is the name of the server you are
testing against).  These defaults can be overridden at run time.
Directions for doing this are contained in the next section.</p>

<h1>
<a id="how-to-run-the-testsuites" class="anchor" href="#how-to-run-the-testsuites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to run the Testsuites</h1>

<p>There are two ways to run the tests: use the server shell script or
mount, run the tests yourself, and unmount.  We recommend you use the
server script to run the tests.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-server-script" class="anchor" href="#the-server-script" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The server script:</h2>

<p>The server script executes one or more of the test sets depending on
what option is given (see below).  It is set up to mount, run tests
using the runtests program, and unmount.  It will attempt to unmount
anything mounted on the mount point before attempting to mount the
server file system.  If a test fails, the run is aborted and the file
system is left mounted to assist in troubleshooting the failure.</p>

<p>The server script uses the domount program to mount and unmount the
test file systems.  Since mount can only be executed by root, domount
must have root permission.  The Makefile will attempt to setuid the
domount program to root.  The server script can be run as a
nonprivileged user.  Alternately, you may login as root before you run
server.</p>

<pre><code>server [-a|-b|-g|-s|-l] [-f|-t] [-n] [-o mnt_options] [-p server_path] [-m mntpoint] [-N numpasses] server_name

-a|-b|-g|-s|-l - will be passed on to the runtests scripts.  This argument
          is optional.  The default is read from the initialization
          file, tests.init.  The variable, TEST, contains this
          argument.
          This argument selects which tests to run:
        -a  run basic, general, special, and lock tests
        -b  run basic tests only
        -g  run general tests only
        -s  run special tests only
        -l  run lock tests only
-f|-t       - will be passed on to the runtests scripts.  This argument
          is optional.  The default is read from the initialization
          file, tests.init.  The variable, TESTARG, contains this
          argument.
          This argument selects how the basic tests are to be run:
        -f  a quick functionality test
        -t  extended test mode with timings
-n      - Don't perform the mkdir and rmdir operations to create
          and destroy the test directory.
-o mnt_options - will be passed on to the mount command.  This argument is
          optional.  The default is read from the initialization
          file, tests.init.  The variable, MNTOPTIONS, contains this
          argument.
-p server_path - specifies a directory on the server to mount.  This
          argument is optional.  The default is read from the
          initialization file, tests.init.  The variable, SERVPATH,
          contains this argument.
-m mntpoint    - specifies a mount point on your client. This argument is
          optional.  The default is read from the initialization
          file, tests.init.  The variable, MNTPOINT, contains this
          argument.
-N numpasses - will be passed to the runtests script.  This argument
          is optional.  It specifies the number of times to run
          through the tests.
server_name - the server you want to exercise.  This is the only
          required argument.
</code></pre>

<p>The test programs create a sub-directory in the mntpoint directory with
the name, 'hostname'.test, (where 'hostname' is the name of the machine
on which you run the tests).  This name can not be overridden if you
use the server script although it can be if you use runtests directly.</p>

<h2>
<a id="run-tests-yourself" class="anchor" href="#run-tests-yourself" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Run tests yourself:</h2>

<p>There is a runtest script in the highest level directory (the master
runtests) which uses tests.init to set up the test environment and then
executes the runtest scripts in the basic, general, and/or special
sub-directories.</p>

<pre><code>runtests [-a|-b|-g|-s|-l] [-f|-n|-t] [-N numpasses] [test-directory]

-a             - Run the basic, general, special, and lock tests.  This
         is the default.
-b         - Run the basic tests.
-g         - Run the general tests.
-s         - Run the special tests.
-l         - Run the lock tests.
-f         - Set parameters for a quick functional test.  It
         applies only to basic tests.
-n             - Suppress directory operations (mkdir and rmdir) on the
         test-directory.  See descriptions of basic tests for
         more details.
-t             - Run full-length test with running time statistics. It
         only applies to basic tests.  This is the default mode
         for the basic tests.
-N numpasses   - Run the tests "numpasses" times.
test-directory - The name of test directory that the test programs
         create on the client.  runtests executes the basic
         tests in place and they work on the test directory.
         The general tests are copied over to the test
         directory and executed there.  When the -n flag is
         used, the test directory is assumed to already exist.

         The default test-directory is
         /mnt.'servername'/'hostname'.test (where 'servername'
         is the name of the server being tested, and
         'hostname' is the name of the machine on which you
         are running the tests).  There are three ways to
         override the default test directory name.  One it to
         put the test_directory on the command line.  Another
         way is to set the environment variable, NFSTESTDIR,
         equal to the directory name.  The command line method
         overrides setting the environment variable.  The
         third way can only be used for the tests in the basic
         sub-directory.  There you can set the TESTDIR
         variable in tests.h.  The command line and
         environment variable both override this method.
</code></pre>

<p>Running the tests without mounting your NFS server on /mnt will run the
tests locally (if /mnt is local disk).  We recommend that you do this
once to make sure the testsuites run properly before you use them to
test NFS.</p>

<p>The runtests in the sub-directories, basic, general, and special, may
be invoked with the same arguments as the master runtests if you wish
to run each suite separately.</p>

<a id="how-to-run-the-testsuites-at-connectathon" class="anchor" href="#how-to-run-the-testsuites-at-connectathon" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to run the Testsuites at Connectathon</h1>

<p>The tests should be run in the following order: basic, general, and
special.  The basic tests should be passed completely before other
tests are attempted.</p>

<p>The NFS Test Suite should be run in three phases:</p>

<p>Phase 1 - Run test programs locally.</p>

<p>Phase 2 - Run the tests against a Sun.  Run them on your machine using
      the Sun as the server and then run them on the Sun using your
      machine as the server.</p>

<p>Phase 3 - NxN Testing.  Run the tests on your machine using every other
      machine as a server,  one at a time.  After the tests are
      successfully completed using a particular server, log that
      with the electronic board software provided.  Check the
      electronic board to make sure that the tests run successfully
      on every other machine that uses your machine as a server.</p>

<h1>
<a id="test-descriptions" class="anchor" href="#test-descriptions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Test Descriptions</h1>

<p>System and library calls that are used by the testsuites are included
in parentheses.  Look at the source if you are interested in how time
statistics are recorded since that is not included in this description.</p>

<h2>
<a id="basic-tests" class="anchor" href="#basic-tests" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BASIC TESTS:</h2>

<p>Many of the programs listed below have optional calling parameters that
can be used to override existing parameters.  These are not used at
this time so they are not described.</p>

<h3>
<a id="test1-file-and-directory-creation-test" class="anchor" href="#test1-file-and-directory-creation-test" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test1: File and Directory Creation Test</h3>

<p>This program creates the test directory (mkdir) on the client and
changes directories (chdir) to it, unless the -n flag is used in which
case it simply changes directories to the test directory.  Then it
builds a directory tree N levels deep, where each directory (including
the test directory) has M files and P directories (creat, close, chdir,
and mkdir).  For the -f option, N = 2, M = 2, and P = 2 so a total of
six files and six directories are created.  For other options, N = 5,
M = 5, and P = 2.  The files that are created are given names that
begin with "file." and directories with names that begin with "dir.".</p>

<h3>
<a id="test2-file-and-directory-removal-test" class="anchor" href="#test2-file-and-directory-removal-test" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test2: File and directory removal test</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and removes the directory tree (unlink, chdir, and rmdir) that
was just created by test1.  The number of levels, files, and
directories, and the name prefixes, are the same as in test1.</p>

<p>This routine will not remove a file or directory that was not created
by test1 and will fail if it finds one.  It determines this by looking
at the prefix on the name of the object it's trying to remove.</p>

<h3>
<a id="test3-lookups-across-mount-point" class="anchor" href="#test3-lookups-across-mount-point" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test3: Lookups across mount point</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and gets the file status of the working directory (getwd or
getcwd and stat).  For the -f option, the getwd or getcwd is done once.
For other options, 250 getcwds or getcwds are done.</p>

<h3>
<a id="test4-setattr-getattr-and-lookup" class="anchor" href="#test4-setattr-getattr-and-lookup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test4: setattr, getattr, and lookup</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates ten files (creat).  Then the permissions are changed
(chmod) and the file status is retrieved (stat) for each file.  For the
-f option, one chmod and stat on each file is done.  For other options,
50 getcwds or getcwds and stats on each file are done.</p>

<h4>
<a id="test4a--getattr-and-lookup" class="anchor" href="#test4a--getattr-and-lookup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test4a:  getattr, and lookup</h4>

<p>This test exists but is not called as part of the testsuite.  You can
edit runtests in the basic directory so this test is called.</p>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates ten files (creat).  Then the file status is
retrieved (stat) for each file.  For the -f option, the stat is done
once per file.  For other options, 50 stats are done per file.</p>

<h3>
<a id="test5-read-and-write" class="anchor" href="#test5-read-and-write" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test5: read and write</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creates a file (creat)</li>
<li>Gets status of file (fstat)</li>
<li>Checks size of file</li>
<li>Writes 1048576 bytes into the file (write) in 8192 byte buffers.</li>
<li>Closes file (close)</li>
<li>Gets status of file (stat)</li>
<li>Checks the size of the file</li>
</ol>

<p>For the -f option, the file is created and written once.  For other
options, file is created and written 10 times.</p>

<p>Then the file is opened (open) and read (read) in 8192 byte buffers.
It's contents are compared with what was written.  The file is then
closed (close).</p>

<p>Then the file is then re-opened (open) and re-read (read) before it is
removed (unlink).  For the -f option, this sequence is done once.  For
other options, this sequence is done 10 times.</p>

<h4>
<a id="test5a-write" class="anchor" href="#test5a-write" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test5a: write</h4>

<p>This test exists but is not called as part of the testsuite.  You can
edit runtests in the basic directory so this test is called.</p>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creates a file (creat)</li>
<li>Gets status of file (fstat)</li>
<li>Checks size of file</li>

<p>This test exists but is not called as part of the testsuite.  You can
edit runtests in the basic directory so this test is called.</p>

<p>The file created in test5a is opened (open) and read (read) in 8192 byte
buffers.  It's contents are compared with what was written.  The file is
then closed (close) and removed (unlink).</p>

<p>For the -f option, the file is opened and read once.  For other
options, file is created and written 10 times.</p>

<h3>
<a id="test6-readdir" class="anchor" href="#test6-readdir" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test6: readdir</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates 200 files (creat).  The current directory is opened
(opendir), the beginning is found (rewinddir), and the directory is
read (readdir) in a loop until the end is found.  Errors flagged are:</p>

<ol>
<li>No entry for "."</li>
<li>No entry for ".."</li>
<li>Duplicate entry</li>
<li>Filename that doesn't begin with "file."</li>
<li>The suffix of the filename is out of range</li>
<li>An entry is returned for an unlinked file. (This error can only be
found when the test is run with an option other than -f.   For other
options the rewinddir/readdir loop is done 200 times and a file is
unlinked each time).</li>
</ol>

<p>The directory is then closed (closedir) and the files that were created
are removed (unlink).</p>

<h3>
<a id="test7-link-and-rename" class="anchor" href="#test7-link-and-rename" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test7: link and rename</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates ten files.  For each of these files, the file is
renamed (rename) and file statistics are retrieved (stat) for both the
new and old names.  Errors that are flagged are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Old file still exists</li>
<li>New file doesn't exist (can't stat)</li>
<li>The new file's number of links doesn't equal one</li>
</ol>

<p>Then an attempt is made to link the new file to it's old name (link)
and file stats are again retrieved (stat).  An error is flagged if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't link</li>
<li>Stats on new file can't be retrieved after link</li>
<li>The new file's number of links doesn't equal two</li>
<li>Stats on old file can't be retrieved after link</li>
<li>The old file's number of links doesn't equal two</li>
</ol>

<p>Then the new file is removed (unlink) and file stats are retrieved for
the old file (stat).  An error is flagged if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stats on old file can't be retrieved after unlink</li>
<li>The old file's number of links doesn't equal one</li>
</ol>

<p>For the -f option, the rename/link/unlink loop is done once for each
file.  For other options, the rename/link/unlink loop is done 10 times
for each file.</p>

<p>Any files that remain at the end of the test are removed (unlink).</p>

<h4>
<a id="test7a-rename" class="anchor" href="#test7a-rename" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test7a: rename</h4>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates ten files.  For each of these files, the file is
renamed (rename) and file statistics are retrieved (stat) for both the
new and old names.  Errors that are flagged are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Old file still exists</li>
<li>New file doesn't exist (can't stat)</li>
<li>The new file's number of links doesn't equal one</li>
</ol>

<p>The file is then renamed back to its original name and the same tests
are applied.</p>

<p>For the -f option, the rename/rename loop is done once for each file.
For other options, the rename/rename loop is done 10 times for each
file.</p>

<p>Any files that remain at the end of the test are removed (unlink).</p>

<p>This test exists but is not called as part of the testsuite.  You can
edit runtests in the basic directory so this test is called.</p>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and creates ten files.  A link (link) is done for each of these
files and file stats are retrieved for the old and new files (stat).
An error is flagged if:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can't link</li>
<li>Stats on either file can't be retrieved after link</li>
<li>The either file's number of links doesn't equal two</li>

<p>NOTE:   Not all operating systems support symlink and readlink.  If the
    errno, EOPNOTSUPP, is returned during test8, the test will be
    counted as passing.  For clients not supporting S_IFLNK, the
    test will not be attempted.</p>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and makes 10 symlinks (symlink).  It reads (readlink), and gets
statistics for (lstat) each, and then removes them (unlink).  Errors
flagged are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unsupported function</li>
<li>Can't get statistics (lstat failed)</li>
<li>The mode in the stats is not symlink</li>
<li>The value of the symlink is incorrect (returned from readlink)</li>
<li>The linkname is wrong</li>
<li>The unlink failed</li>
</ol>

<p>For the -f option, the symlink/readlink/unlink loop is done for each
symlink.  For other options, the symlink/readlink/unlink loop is done
20 times for each symlink.</p>

<a id="test9-statfs" class="anchor" href="#test9-statfs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>test9: statfs</h3>

<p>This program changes directory to the test directory (chdir and/or
mkdir) and gets the file system status on the current directory
(statfs).  For the -f option, the statfs is done once.  For other
options, the statfs is done 1500 times.</p>

<p>The special directory is set up to test special problems that have come
up in the past.  These tests are meant to be advisory, things to watch
out for.  It is not required that you "pass" these tests but we
strongly suggest that you do.</p>

<p>The tests try to:</p>

<pre><code>  check for proper open/unlink operation
  check for proper open/rename operation
  check for proper open/chmod 0 operation
  check for lost reply on non-idempotent requests
  test exclusive create
  test negative seek
  test rename
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="lock" class="anchor" href="#lock" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LOCK:</h2>

<p>The lock directory contains a test program which can be used to test
the kernel file and record locking facilities.  This is done to test
the network lock manager.</p>

<p>The test program contains 13 sets of locking tests.  They test basic
locking functionality.</p>

<p>By default, mandatory locking is not tested.  Mandatory locking is
generally <em>not</em> supported on NFS files.</p>

<p>'Testitems' is a list of NFS functionality that can be used for
reference.</p>

<p>Programs in 'tools' are provided for your use as you see fit.  Please
feel free to add to this (or any other) directory!  If you do, please
make sure that Mike Kupfer <a href="mailto:mike.kupfer@sun.com">mike.kupfer@sun.com</a> gets a copy so we can
add it to the master test distribution.</p>

<p>The code in this tree was checked August 1998 for Y2000 problems.
None were found.</p>

<p>See READWIN.txt for information about running the tests under DOS or
